[![Test](https://github.com/ruicosta042/rssconv-action/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ruicosta042/rssconv-action/actions/workflows/test.yml)

An action to retrofit RSS feeds to suit my needs.

## Feeds

#### reddit

Feeds from reddit will list all posts on a subreddit. I'm only interested on link shares, not on text posts. On link shares, I want to be given the URL directly, not the reddit post that points to the link.

#### Cooperpress

Each issue on a newsletter is a single item on the feed. I want each link on an issue to be an item on the feed.

#### Harper's Magazine

For some reason Reeder doesn't parse this feed. This just parses the original feed and converts to RSS 2.0.
