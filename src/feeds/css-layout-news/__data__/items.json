It&apos;s a four day weekend here, although like many freelancers I worked most of the holiday days. I did get to spend Easter Monday working on some content about the new container queries spec for MDN though. Hopefully I&apos;ll get that finished this week.</p><p>With Easter over I&apos;m looking forward to the upcoming An Event Apart Spring Summit. I miss meeting up with the AEA crew in person so much, but the line-up for the Spring Summit is fantastic and I know everyone has put a lot of time and thought into their presentations. Take a look at the details in the footer of this email, and I hope to see you there.</p><p><em>Rachel Andrew, CSS Layout News</em></p><h2 id=\"learn\">Learn</h2><h3 id=\"not-your-typical-horizontal-rules\"><a href=\"https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/horizontal-rules/\">Not Your Typical Horizontal Rules</a></h3><p>This is a lovely article about the humble <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> element, why you should consider using it, and how to make them look nice while retaining their semantics.</p><p><em><a href=\"https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/horizontal-rules/\">sarasoueidan.com</a></em></p><hr><h3 id=\"swipey-image-grids\"><a href=\"https://www.cassie.codes/posts/swipey-image-grids/\">Swipey image grids.</a></h3><p>This is a really great article on creating image grids not with CSS Grid, but instead with SVG.</p><p><em><a href=\"https://www.cassie.codes/posts/swipey-image-grids/\">cassie.codes</a></em></p><hr><h3 id=\"let%E2%80%99s-create-an-image-pop-out-effect-with-svg-clip-path-css-tricks\"><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/lets-create-an-image-pop-out-effect-with-svg-clip-path/\">Let&#x2019;s Create an Image Pop-Out Effect With SVG Clip Path | CSS-Tricks</a></h3><p>I&apos;m a big fan of articles that riff of another article or demo, adding value in the process.

It shouldn&apos;t initially make any real difference in terms of receiving the newsletter, however it will let me do some more interesting things in terms of layout resources later.</p><p>Until then, here is the usual round-up of CSS layout adjacent things.</p><p><em>Rachel Andrew, CSS Layout News</em></p><hr><h3 id=\"css-multi-column-layout-module-level-1\"><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-multicol-1/\">CSS Multi-column Layout Module Level 1</a></h3><p>I published a new Working Draft of multicol last week.

Floats, just like tables, are not <em>deprecated</em>. Nor will sites using them for column based layout stop working. You probably don&apos;t want to build a new site using floated columns though.</p><p>The article doesn&apos;t mention one use of the <code>float</code> property right now however, if you want to use CSS Shapes you can only do so on a floated element.</p><p><em><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/is-css-float-deprecated/\">css-tricks.com</a></em></p><hr><h3 id=\"bruce-lawson%E2%80%99s-personal-site-don%E2%80%99t-put-pointer-events-none-on-form-labels\"><a href=\"https://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2021/dont-put-pointer-events-none-on-form-labels/\">Bruce Lawson&#x2019;s personal site &#xA0;: Don&#x2019;t put pointer-events: none on form labels</a></h3><p>A reminder, and perhaps something to check on existing sites to make sure that any library you have been using hasn&apos;t done so.</p><p><em><a href=\"https://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2021/dont-put-pointer-events-none-on-form-labels/\">brucelawson.co.uk</a></em></p><h2 id=\"interesting\">Interesting</h2><h3 id=\"about-us-pop-out-effect\"><a href=\"https://codepen.io/ainalem/pen/QWGNzYm\">About Us Pop-Out Effect</a></h3><p>This is nice, using <code>clip-path</code>.

If you have never used CSS for print, then you might feel this is all a bit irrelevant; however, I&apos;d love to know if page or column floats are at all interesting to people who build for the web. Would it be useful, for example, to be able to cause an image always to appear at the top of a column in a multiple-column layout? If you have use cases, let me know.</p><p><em><a href=\"https://www.princexml.com/howcome/2021/guides/float/index.html\">princexml.com</a></em></p>"
